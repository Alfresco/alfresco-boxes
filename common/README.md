Running VM on Vagrant

If you want to run the VM you just created with VirtualBox you can use the [Vagrantfile](https://github.com/maoo/alfresco-boxes/tree/master/common/Vagrantfile) that you find in the root folder; before you run the first time, install the following Vagrant plugins

To run the VM, simply type ```vagrant up``` from ```alfresco-boxes/common``` folder
