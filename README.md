### What is it

Alfresco SPK is a toolset that can be used by stack operators (Devops/Architects/Engineers, Support, QA, Sales, Marketing, ...) to define Alfresco immutable Images, testing them locally first, also for arbitrarily complex architectures.

It allows you to:

- Run an arbitrarily complex stack locally
- Build (immutable) image(s) with the exact same provisioning logic used for local run
- Test immutable images locally
- Run a stack on any orchestration tool with the same provisioning logic used for local runs
